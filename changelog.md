This update brings a few QOL improvements to the **timeline configuration system**, making the simulator bit more usable. This should especially help users on **lower resolutions**. It also includes a small UI fix related to dropdowns.

## Changelog:

### Changes

-   **Reworked the timeline configuration menu**: It has been moved from the **top menu bar** into its own **dedicated popup window** for better organization and usability on smaller screens.
-   Updated, changed and rearranged several **timeline configuration options** for multiple fights to improve clarity and flexibility.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed an issue where certain **dropdown menus** were not properly **interactable** in some cases.
