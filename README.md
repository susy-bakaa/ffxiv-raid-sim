# ffxiv-raid-sim

A singleplayer raid and fight mechanic simulator with full bot support, made with the Unity game engine for the critically acclaimed MMORPG FINAL FANTASY XIV: Online. 

This program is completely separate from the game and does not directly interact with it in anyway. More timelines and fights will be added to this as we develop it further. We are also accepting any external thirdparty contributions by anyone. 

This simulator mainly focuses on battles, mechanics and fights, which are missing from other simulators, do not have bot support available anywhere else, are old/badly made or sometimes simply do not exist at all yet, such as older ultimates, older savages, "easier" fights not worth a sim by others, side battle content, bozja duels or blue mage raids.

If you want to keep up with development, have any questions or want to contribute yourself, best place to do all of that is the discord server. You can also follow my personal socials for occasional updates or other misc content possibly related to this program or FFXIV in general.

# Supported fights

Fights listed here are finished and available in the simulator.

<b>NOTE:</b> This simulator is mainly being built with raiding strats from the European data center, which are usually either from LPDU or just whatever ends up popular in EU PF. Reason being that I personally mostly only play in that region. I do not have the time to maintain and add 10 different versions of one strategy, however if anyone else wants to contribute other strats, you're free to do so and I encourage you to give it a go! For help with this, I recommend you join our discord and contact us there for additional information regarding that.

(These ones are not guranteed and more of a MAYBE, because [another sim with bots](https://github.com/WCGH/FRU-Sim) already exists and [XIVSim](https://www.xivsim.com/game/) has support for them. Or they might not be that useful in my opinion.)

This program has a web version that runs inside your browser if you do not want to download anything. The web version is available in Itch.io or on my personal website. Your other option is to download the program archive and run it on your local machine. The program archive can be downloaded directly from this repo's [releases section](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim/releases) or through the itch.io page. All versions of the program are nearly identical except the web version has issues with controller support on some browsers. If you run into issues try a Chromium-based browser. 

The web version fetches it's visual assets (Like character and enemy models) from a remote server, which can sometimes be down. If you do not see any character models be sure to check back later, as I usually manage to fix any issues with the server in a day or two.

For the standalone downloadable version, you need to first download the right archive for your respective operating system. This program currently only supports 64-bit Windows and Linux. 

After downloading the archive, you then need to extract it with some tool such as 7zip or your OS built-in tool into a writable location. This should be a location where your user has full write, read and execution permissions on both platforms. If you install the application into folder that requires elevated permissions, the automatic updater will fail to install any future updates.

After you have extracted the game, on Windows you can launch the "raidsim.exe" executable directly to begin using it. On Linux you might need to first mark the game as executable, because .Zip archives often lose unix permissions. To do so, just run the following command inside the folder of the application in your terminal: `chmod 755 ./raidsim`. Now you should be able to just launch the "raidsim" executable file directly.

This application includes an automatic updater that should apply updates to the program automatically once an update is detected and downloaded. If once an update has been installed and you press to restart in the simulator nothing happens, this is most likely due to your OS blocking the "updater" program. To make it work in this case, just launch it first directly through the installation folder to start it once and make sure it opens before retrying the update through the main simulator program. On Windows, most of the time the issue is simply solved by doing this and pressing "Allow" in the Windows Smart Screen. The updater's source code is included in this repository if you want to take a look at it and verify what it does. Using the updater is also completely optional and it can be toggled off.

If you instead want to download the source code or expand upon this program in some other way, firstly thank you for your interest and to do so, check the git instructions below and/or contact me or the other developers through Discord or contact me directly on Twitter/Bluesky and I will get back to you.

# Git Usage Instructions

This repository uses [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) for storage of larger files. This means that if you're an external contributor you need to manually download the latest asset archive from here: [ffxiv-raid-sim.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybYaJ8LGnHwY5jeCv1Zr6B5fT7FHL51i/view?usp=drive_link). I hope to improve this workflow eventually, sorry for the inconvenience.

If you are interested in creating new timelines or want to provide other things to the application that require pull requests, here's few key details to keep in mind when submitting your changes.
- Main development happens on the `dev` branch, so pull requests directly to there will be approved faster and are more likely to be included in the current update in development.
- When creating new timelines, please try to keep the number of scenes at only one scene per mechanic. I know that sometimes it is tricky to implement a completely different strat into an existing scene, but in these cases do not hesitate on asking for some help from me directly or on the discord server. You will most certainly be helped with your work.
- Try to keep your changes focused and do not submit big pull requests with lots of unrelated changes. One request per timeline added, one request per all strats added or one per code change is a heavy preference. Do not be afraid to bundle them together however if they are related in anyway, like if they are different strats to the same fight.
