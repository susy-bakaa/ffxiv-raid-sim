# ffxiv-raid-sim

A singleplayer raid and fight mechanic simulator with full bot support, made with the Unity game engine for the critically acclaimed MMORPG FINAL FANTASY XIV: Online. This program is completely separate from the game and does not interact with it in anyway. More timelines and fights will be added to this as we develop it further. We are also accepting any external thirdparty contributions by anyone. This simulator mainly focuses on battles, mechanics and fights, which are missing from other simulators, do not have bot support available anywhere else, are old/badly made or sometimes simply do not exist at all yet, such as older ultimates, older savages, "easier" fights not worth sim by others, side battle content, bozja duels or blue mage raids.

If you want to keep up with development, have any questions or want to contribute yourself, best place to do all of that is the discord server. You can also follow my personal socials for occasional updates or other misc content possibly related to this program or FFXIV in general.

# Supported fights

Fights listed here are finished and available in the simulator.

<b>NOTE:</b> This simulator is mainly being built with raiding strats from the European data center, from LPDU or just whatever ends up popular in EU PF, as I personally mostly only play in that region. I do not have the time to maintain and add 10 different versions of one strategy, however if anyone else wants to contribute other strats, you're free to do so and I encourage you to give it a go! For help with this, I recommend you join our discord and contact us there for additional information regarding that.

(These ones are not guranteed and more of a MAYBE, because [another sim with bots](https://github.com/WCGH/FRU-Sim) already exists and [XIVSim](https://www.xivsim.com/game/) has support for them. Or they might not be that useful in my opinion.)

This program has a web version that runs inside your browser if you do not want to download anything, it is available in Itch.io or on my personal website, the choice is yours. Your other option is to download the program archive and run it on your machine. The program archive can be downloaded directly from this repo's [releases section](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim/releases) or through the itch.io page. All versions of the program are nearly identical except the web version lacks controller support due to Unity not having it easily available for WebGL games and the Linux build currently lacks automatic update support. 

The web version downloads it's visual assets (Like character and enemy models) from remote server, which can sometimes be down. If you do not see any character models be sure to check back later, as I usually manage to fix any issues with the server in a day or two.

For the standalone downloadable version, you need to first extract the .Zip archive with some tool such as 7zip and then you can launch the raidsim.exe (Windows) or raidsim.x86_64 (Linux) depending on your platform. The build available for Linux is not well tested yet so it might have some minor issues. If you instead want to download the source code or expand upon this program, firstly thank you for your interest and to do so, check the git instructions below and/or contact me or the other developers through Discord or contact me directly on Twitter/Bluesky and I will get back to you.

# Git Usage Instructions

This repository uses [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) for storage of larger files. This means that if you're an external contributor you need to manually download the latest asset archive from here: [ffxiv-raid-sim.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybYaJ8LGnHwY5jeCv1Zr6B5fT7FHL51i/view?usp=drive_link). I hope to improve this workflow eventually, sorry for the inconvenience.
