# ffxiv-raid-sim

A singleplayer raid and fight mechanic simulator with bots, made in the Unity game engine from scratch, for the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV: Online by Square Enix. This program will get more timelines and fights added to it as I develop it further. I will also accept any external thirdparty contributions possibly developed by others. Current main focus is Blue Mage specific plans for older fights and mechanics with various ultimate mechanics missing from other simulators thrown in to the mix, with maybe an occasional savage mechanic if I feel like it.

If you want to keep up with development, have any questions or want to contribute yourself, join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/wepQtPfC6D).

# Supported fights

This simulator is mainly being built with European raiding strats from LPDU or whatever is popular in EU PF, as I personally play in the EU data center. If anyone wants to contribute NA or JP equivalent strats for this, you're free to do so and I encourage you to contact me for additional info regarding that through Discord (@no00ob).

(These ones are not guranteed and more of a MAYBE, because [another sim with bots](https://github.com/WCGH/FRU-Sim) already exists and [XIVSim](https://www.xivsim.com/game/) has support for them. Or they might not be that useful in my opinion.)

# Installation

Download Latest Build: [Windows x64](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim/releases/download/v.0.6.2/raidsim_v.0.6.2_win64.zip) [Linux x64](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim/releases/download/v.0.6.2/raidsim_v.0.6.2_linux64.zip)

You have two options when it comes to using this program, either open the [web version](https://susybaka.dev/unityweb/raidsim/index.html) or just head over to the [releases section](https://github.com/susy-bakaa/ffxiv-raid-sim/releases) and download the latest archive file for your respective operating system. They are both the same exact program and version except the web one lacks controller support due to Unity not having it for WebGL games. For the standalone version, you need to extract the .Zip archive with some tool such as 7zip and then open up the raidsim.exe or raidsim.x86_64 to launch the program. The build available for Linux is not well tested so it might have some issues. If you instead want to download the source code or expand upon this program, check the git instructions down below and/or contact me on Discord @no00ob or Twitter [@susyy_bakaa](https://x.com/susyy_bakaa) and I will get back to you.

# Git Usage Instructions

For more in-depth guide, please check out the [official documentation website](https://docs.susybaka.dev/raidsim/).

This repository uses [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) for LFS storage. To learn more about installing gdrive follow [this guide](https://medium.com/machine-learning-intuition/tutorial-storing-large-a-i-models-with-gdrive-don-t-use-git-lfs-a1aaccdc5b26). To get started, edit `gdrive_default.txt` located inside the `.gdrive` directory on the project root. Each line corresponds to one variable. After you're done save it as `gdrive_config.txt` into the same folder.

Config file explanation:
1. Disk your repository is on
2. Path to your local repository (In a format the windows cd command can read)
3. Name of the archive used with Google Drive
4. File ID of your existing archive on Google Drive (Must be shared to everyone with link)
5. Folder ID of the folder where your archive will sit in (Must be shared to everyone with link)
6. File used for ignored folders and file types (By default `.gdriveignore`)

After configuring the settings simply run `gdrive_util.bat` located in the root folder after commiting other changes to GitHub and follow the instructions on the cmd window to manage your Google Drive backups of large files. If you do not have access to the original archive used in this project, as in you're an external contributor, you may manually download the asset archive from here: [ffxiv-raid-sim.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ybYaJ8LGnHwY5jeCv1Zr6B5fT7FHL51i/view?usp=drive_link)
